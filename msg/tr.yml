    Long ago, this pebble was forged 

    in the fiery pits of Tartarus,

    {:clear }by the grand blacksmith of Lucifer himself {:clear }in a time long before

    the world began.{:clear }War upon war was waged 

    in the abyss of pain{:clear }before it was ultimately bequeathed

    to the lowliest of peasants, {:clear }a man named Makenzie.{:clear }Quickly corrupted by its power,

    he began a lone siege of the kingdom.{:clear }Having seized power, 

    war after war was waged,{:clear }all sourced from the newly-crowned king's

    lust for strength. {:clear }Generations of kings continued his conquest:

    Yamato, Carrie, Budva, Logan, Bread,

    and many others were led astray

    by its perverting power.{:clear }Each king fought on the front-line

    of their bloodshed.{:clear }Finally, another king,

    blessed by the gods, confronted the pebble

    with the mighty weapon Demon's Bane,{:clear }and felled the depraved regent.

    {:clear }For centuries it lay dormant in the vaults,{:clear }only being unearthed

    when the kingdom was on death's door.{:clear }The finest warrior would be tasked

    with exclusively wielding both weapons.{:clear }But treachery! The thief Cocainus 

    had obtained the holy weapon!{:clear }Confronting him, the pebble's wielder

    slew him in a single strike,{:clear }but not before his foe could reciprocate.

    {:clear }And thus, Mardoza, Guardian of the Pebble, 

    fell to his knees, {:clear }and passed from this world,

    leaving behind the mighty weapon.{:clear }For he knew that one day, 

    its power would be required once more.
